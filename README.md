# Data Structures and Algorithms

Taken Fall of 2022. All pdf files were created with LaTeX. 
#### Note: The Jupyter Notebook with the final code does not display the output properly. It only seems to work inside of Google Colab, but a link to the Colab notebook is attached to the notebook in this repo.

## Description:
This course is a detailed introduction to advanced algorithms and data structures used in the computational science MS program.

### Prerequisites:
Prerequisites: CS 301 and MATH 330.

### Credits:
(4)

### Learner Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
